# Documentation Index

This directory contains all project documentation organized by type and purpose.

## Structure

### /features/
Product feature specifications and documentation. Each feature is documented with its current status:
- **LIVE** - Deployed and available in production
- **TESTING** - Built and being tested, not yet released
- **WORKING** - Currently under development
- **BACKLOG** - Planned but not started

Features are the source of truth for what functionality exists or is planned in the project.

### /guides/
Technical documentation, how-to guides, and procedures. Includes:
- Setup and installation instructions
- Development workflows
- Troubleshooting guides
- Best practices and conventions
- API documentation

## Usage

- **Feature Planning**: Start by creating a feature document in `/features/` with BACKLOG status
- **Implementation**: Update feature status as work progresses through the pipeline
- **Documentation**: Create guides in `/guides/` for recurring procedures or complex workflows
- **Reference**: All team members should refer to these docs as the authoritative source
