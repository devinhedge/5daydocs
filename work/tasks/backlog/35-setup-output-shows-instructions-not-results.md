# Setup Output Messages Show Instructions Instead of Results

## Problem
The setup.sh completion messages tell the user to do things the script should have already done (e.g., "1. cd $TARGET_PATH" when the script could report it already changed there, "4. Create your first task using..." when scripts are already executable).

## Desired Outcome
Output messages should report what was accomplished, not instruct what to do next:
- "✓ Scripts are executable at work/scripts/"
- "✓ Documentation available at DOCUMENTATION.md"
- "✓ Task templates ready in work/tasks/"
- Only show actual next steps that require user action

## Testing Criteria
- [ ] Output messages confirm completed actions
- [ ] No redundant instructions for completed tasks
- [ ] Clear distinction between what was done and what user needs to do
- [ ] Concise, informative completion summary
